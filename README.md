Create a logarithmic plot of the frequency of gaps between primes up to an arbitrary number.

This was inspired by the the video of Stand-up Maths:

For the log line he calculated the gaps for the first 150,000,000 primes (minute 18:40) This should be able to calcutate within 300 seconds in Python according to my graph https://github.com/kreier/prime
